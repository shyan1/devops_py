Original sleeve notes for the album: "Book of Dreams" was inspired by notes
about dreams I wrote down shortly after I woke up from my sleep. In those
strange moments between fantasy and reality, when you can still remember the
images and feelings of the dream before they are rubbed off by daytime thoughts
and troubles. The compositions which can be heard on this album trying to
recapture those images and feelings mixed with a second thought, kind of a
sober interpretation of the sometimes wild and furious adventures with somnia.
